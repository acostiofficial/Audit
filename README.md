This report has been prepared for CatCoin V2 to discover issues and vulnerabilities in the source code ofthe CatCoin V2 project as well as any contract dependencies that were not part of an officially recognizedlibrary. A comprehensive examination has been performed, utilizing Static Analysis and Manual Reviewtechniques.The auditing process pays special attention to the following considerations:Testing the smart contracts against both common and uncommon attack vectors.Assessing the codebase to ensure compliance with current best practices and industry standards.Ensuring contract logic meets the specifications and intentions of the client.Cross referencing contract structure and implementation against similar smart contracts producedby industry leaders.Thorough line-by-line manual review of the entire codebase by industry experts.The security assessment resulted in findings that ranged from critical to informational. We recommendaddressing these findings to ensure a high level of security standards and industry practices. We suggestrecommendations that could better serve the project from the security perspective:Enhance general coding practices for better structures of source codes;Add enough unit tests to cover the possible use cases;Provide more comments per each function for readability, especially contracts that are verified inpublic;Provide more transparency on privileged activities once the protocol is live.
